For the following two, you can simply take a 30 second pretend audio recording & video recording to use, we are just trying to get you familiar with the <audio> and <video> elements. Yes, you must have both audio and video elements, and yes, you can use the audio from the video you took for the audio element, it just has to be in a separate audio file.

            <p>Regarding prosecution of elements of Wario Banks. It seems even relatively high level management was not included in the scandal or accountable for acts in the Wario files. This... emotional testimony, recovered from a company computer. The travel dates of these individuals combined with the meta data of this document make its deliberate fabrication unlikely.</p>
            
            <p>It is my recommendation based on this that Mushroom Kingdom Intelligence Services reserve suspicioun to the target himself and his friend circle. The asylum claims of Wario Banks employees, managers, and affiliates should be held as valid. These individuals and their families should be afforded justice, protection, and peace of mind.</p>
